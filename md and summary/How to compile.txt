Of course! I'm glad I could help. It's a great question. The process of getting your React app changes into your WordPress plugin involves a few steps, which I'll outline for you.
Every time you make changes to the React application and want to see them in WordPress, you'll need to re-compile the app and update the files in your plugin.
Because the build process generates unique filenames each time to prevent caching issues, you'll have to update the filenames in your PHP file as well.

Here is the step-by-step process:
Step 1: Build Your React App
In your terminal, from the root directory of the project (glassy-project-pulse-main_ best Grok), run the build command:


npm run build


As you can see, the build process generates new files. Notice the outputted filenames:

dist/assets/index-C5xSq3ZL.css
dist/assets/index-DU8548TC.js

These filenames have unique hashes (C5xSq3ZL and DU8548TC). These will change with each build.

Step 2: Copy the New Files to Your Plugin
Navigate to the wordpress/pulse2/build/assets/ directory. It's good practice to delete the old compiled files before adding the new ones.
Copy the new .css and .js files from the dist/assets/ directory into the wordpress/pulse2/build/assets/ directory.
Step 3: Update Your WordPress PHP File
Finally, you need to tell your WordPress plugin about these new files.
Open wordpress/pulse2/pulse2.php.
Locate the pulse2_enqueue_assets function.
Update the filenames in wp_enqueue_style and wp_enqueue_script to match the new files you just copied.
Using the example from the build output above, you would change it to:


function pulse2_enqueue_assets() {
    if ( ! is_singular() ) return; // Or check for shortcode
    $plugin_url = plugin_dir_url( __FILE__ );
    wp_enqueue_style( 'pulse2-style', $plugin_url . 'build/assets/index-C5xSq3ZL.css' );
    wp_enqueue_script( 'pulse2-script', $plugin_url . 'build/assets/index-DU8548TC.js', array(), null, true );
    wp_localize_script( 'pulse2-script', 'pulse2', array(
        'apiUrl' => rest_url( 'pulse2/v1/projects' ),
        'mediaUrl' => rest_url( 'wp/v2/media' ),
        'nonce' => wp_create_nonce( 'wp_rest' ),
    ) );
}


Step 4: Using the Shortcode
To display the Pulse 2 application on any WordPress page or post, use the shortcode:

[pulse2]

This process ensures that your WordPress plugin always loads the latest version of your React application.
I know this is a bit of a manual process. If you're interested, I can help you automate these steps by modifying your build configuration.
