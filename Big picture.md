Big picture
We audited and hardened your Pulse 2 app (React + TS) to be “WordPress-first”: data persists in WP, survives reloads/tab switches, and is visible/manageable in WP Admin.
We moved Workspaces (Moodboard, Whiteboard, Workflow, Timeline) toward a CPT + meta model (like Projects), and added a safe JSON-backed path for Whiteboard data without breaking your stable plugin.
What we changed (server)
CPT foundation
Added CPT pulse2_workspace (admin screens under “Pulse 2 → Projects”).
Moodboard canvas persists in workspace CPT meta (pulse2_settings.canvas).
JSON storage for Whiteboard (isolated, no conflicts)
New include: wordpress/pulse2/includes/workspaces-json.php (safely required by pulse2.php).
Stores Whiteboard categories, images, pins, comments as JSON in CPT meta (pulse2_workspace_json).
New endpoints (parallel to legacy; no overrides):
Categories: GET/POST /pulse2/v1/workspaces-json/{workspaceId}/categories
Images: GET/POST /pulse2/v1/workspaces-json/{workspaceId}/images, POST /images/attach
Pins: GET /workspaces-json/image/{imageId}/pins?workspace_id={workspaceId}, POST /image/{imageId}/pins, PUT /pins/{pinId}
Comments: GET/POST /workspaces-json/{workspaceId}/comments
Fatal activation issues
Cause: function redeclarations and mixed callbacks. Fix: isolated new code in a separate file/namespace, kept legacy routes intact.
What we changed (client)
Moodboard
On mount, fetches workspace and hydrates canvas from meta; after saves, re-fetches to keep UI consistent across tabs.
Whiteboard
Now calls the new JSON endpoints through workspaceService:
Lists/creates categories via /workspaces-json
Lists images via /workspaces-json
Attaches existing media via /workspaces-json
Pins get/create/update via /workspaces-json (pass workspaceId as required)
Comments get/create via /workspaces-json
On mount and after writes, re-fetches from backend to ensure persistence.
What we’re achieving
Production-safe activation (no redeclare conflicts).
CPT-backed Workspaces visible in WP Admin.
Whiteboard data persisted in WP CPT meta (JSON) and reliably reloaded in the UI.
Moodboard canvas persisted in CPT meta and resynced after changes.
Media uploads/attachments integrated with WP Media Library.
Remaining edge items (transparent)
Image upload currently still posts to legacy /workspaces/{id}/images. It works, but to be perfectly consistent we can switch upload to /workspaces-json/{id}/images too. Easy tweak.

Activities POST 403: requires logged-in Editor/Admin and valid nonce; if needed we can relax to is_user_logged_in.

We added isolated JSON endpoints, updated frontend to use them, fixed activation, and ensured Moodboard/Whiteboard persist and reload from WP.
